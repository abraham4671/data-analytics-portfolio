Superstore Sales Analysis

Goal: Analyze sales performance and profitability across regions, categories, and customer segments.

Tools Used:
SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)

Workflow:

1. Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates, normalized category names.
2. SQL Queries: Identified top-performing regions and least profitable categories.
3. EDA in Python: Visualized monthly trends and correlations between discount and profit.

Key Insights:

* High discounts in the "Furniture" category severely cut profits.
* Western region had the highest sales volume but inconsistent margins.
* Repeat customers accounted for 60% of total profit.

Files Included:

* superstore_sql_queries.sql
* superstore_analysis_python.ipynb
