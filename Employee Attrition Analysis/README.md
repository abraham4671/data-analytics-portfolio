Employee Attrition Analysis

Goal: Identify the key factors contributing to employee turnover and help management improve retention.

Tools Used:
SQL, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Tableau

Workflow:

1. Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and outliers.
2. EDA: Used Python to explore trends by age, salary, department, and job satisfaction.
3. SQL Queries: Filtered high-risk employee segments.
4. Visualization: Built a Tableau dashboard showing attrition rates by department and demographics.

Key Insights:

* Employees with low satisfaction and longer tenure were more likely to leave.
* Sales and HR departments showed the highest churn.
* Work-life balance and compensation had strong influence.
